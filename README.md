## Introduction

This project aims to predict the type of failure in industrial manufacturing equipment based on sensor readings and machine operational data. By predicting failures ahead of time, maintenance can be scheduled proactively to minimize downtime, reduce costs, and prevent catastrophic failures.

The dataset contains sensor readings and operational parameters recorded from industrial machinery over time. Each entry represents a snapshot of the equipment's state at a particular moment. The target is to classify different types of potential failures.
